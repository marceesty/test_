# Development

This development environment setup requires docker and docker-compose to have been properly installed on the host's machine

```
# Clone the repository and cd into repository
$ git clone https://git.heroku.com/quickbunny-staging.git

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build and start the containers
